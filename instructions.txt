There are 3 files which are to be run.
All 3 files are python3 code which can be run by typing python3 <filename> into command line.
The needed dependencies are: python3, gcc, matplotlib

Quicksort_comparison.py compares the 3 variations of pivot choices for quick sort
Three graphs are generated showcasing all 3 pivot choices

All_sort_comparison.py compares the 6 sorting algorithms, using random quicksort, which performed the best in quicksort comparison
There are 3 graphs generated, showcasing random, increasing and decreasing arrays.

time-vs-comparisons.py compares the size of array with (execution time / number of comparisons) for 5 of the sorting algorithms
Radix sort is not considered since it is not a comparison sort.
1 graph is generated by this program.

The sorting algorithms are all implemented in C++ due to its relative speed compared to python.
The test case generation is also implemented in C++ for the same reason.
